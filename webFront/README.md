# Web frontend

## Running this portion of the app

### Development build

You'll need node.js installed to make this app work

First make sure you have all the packages installed
```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development build
```bash
npm run dev
```

That will open on some point and print the result in the terminal. Visiting that url will give you a hot reloading dev server

### Production build

Currently you don't :)
